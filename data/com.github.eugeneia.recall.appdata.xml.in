  <description>
    <p>Recall is a frontend to the Recoll full-text desktop search engine.</p>
    <p>An read-time indexing process is started automatically in the background
      and keeps running even when Recall is closed. It may take a while for the
      initial index to be built. Expect a delay before search results become
      comprehensive.</p>
